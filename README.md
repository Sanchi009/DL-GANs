GAN-based Anomaly Detection in Time Series Data: A Case Study with 'data.csv'
<br>
Problem Statement:
The challenge is to develop an effective anomaly detection model for time series data using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). The 'data.csv' dataset, featuring temporal information and multiple features, serves as the basis for identifying abnormal patterns that could indicate potential issues or anomalies within the dataset.
